        ```js
        var addSix = createBase(6);
        addSix(10); // returns 16
        addSix(21); // returns 27
        ```
*/

TASK 2
    Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
